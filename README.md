This Project should use the [Keystudio IOT Smart Home Kit](https://www.keyestudio.com/products/keyestudio-esp32-smart-home-kit-for-esp32-diy-starter-kit-edu) with the ESP32 to controll the House.
The ESP32 should host a Webserver which can configure different things on the House and be able to trigger them aswell.
